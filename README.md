# Stock Pattern Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a Windows Forms application written in C#. It is designed to analyze stock patterns and visualize these patterns using rectangle annotations. The application utilizes object-oriented programming principles, specifically abstract classes and their concrete implementations, to effectively solve the problem of stock pattern analysis.

## Features
- **Stock Pattern Analysis**: Analyze various stock patterns using predefined algorithms.
- **Rectangle Annotation**: Visual representation of detected patterns using rectangle annotations on stock charts.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses abstract classes and derived concrete classes to create a flexible and scalable codebase.

## Project Structure
The project is structured to separate concerns and ensure maintainability. Key components include:

### Abstract Classes
Abstract classes define the blueprint for stock pattern analysis components. These classes provide the basic structure and methods that must be implemented by concrete classes.

### Concrete Classes
Concrete classes derive from abstract classes and implement specific pattern analysis algorithms. Each concrete class corresponds to a different stock pattern type.

### Rectangle Annotation
A dedicated component for creating and managing rectangle annotations on stock charts. This component interacts with the pattern analysis classes to display results.
